      <div>
        <p>Imagine coming home from a long day of work and walking into the kitchen. You open the fridge and see a variety of different ingredients, but you’re at a loss at what exactly to make. This is where we come in.</p>
        
        <p>DansMonFrigo is a search service designed specifically to help the average citizen find recipes that utilize ingredients they have in their fridge. Our search service asks its users to list the ingredients that they currently have on hand. From there, DansMonFrigo will find results tailored to the specific set of ingredients provided. What’s unique about our search service is that our website returns users with results that lists ingredients used in each recipe. This way, users will be able to easily find out what ingredients are needed at a glance.</p>  
        
        <p>We know that we aren’t perfect and we are constantly striving to make our search service better for users like you! One idea that we thought would help users search items more easily is to create a list where users can add ingredients that have into said list. After they input all the ingredients that they have, they can click on the search box and recipes with said ingredients would pop up. Users would also be able to see ingredients that the website used that was similar to what they had by bolded/highlighted text.

        <p>Unfortunately due to the populatrity of the french song "Dans mon frigo" we are having difficulty reaching the front page of Google. Despite that our site has garnered nearly a solid userbase using solely word of mouth. These users typically stay on the website for 8 minutes and 15 seconds with nearly 65% of them being returning users.</p>
